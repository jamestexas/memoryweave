**Note: The benchmark scripts in this directory are currently under development and are likely non-functional. They are not a priority at this time.**

**Do not expect these scripts to work without significant issues.**

For information on the project's development roadmap, please see `docs/development-roadmap.md`.

**Important Notice (March 7, 2025):**

Benchmarks are currently under active development and should not be used for critical performance evaluations in production environments. Please use the results for experimentation and development purposes only.
