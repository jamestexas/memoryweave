# Memory Storage Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes
- Created a better architecture with base stores and adapters
- Improved ID handling across all store types
- Added dedicated vector search component with multiple implementations
- Standardized interfaces across all components
- Fixed ID resolution issues
- Created factory with Pydantic configuration

## Components Replaced
- `storage/memory_store.py` → `storage/refactored/memory_store.py`
- `storage/chunked_memory_store.py` → `storage/refactored/chunked_store.py`
- `storage/hybrid_memory_store.py` → `storage/refactored/hybrid_store.py`
- Added dedicated `storage/vector_search/` package

## Transition Strategy
1. Update imports to use refactored components
2. Test to ensure functionality is maintained
3. Remove deprecated files

## Future Improvements
- Full integration of FAISS for larger memory stores
- Add Hybrid BM25+Vector search implementation
