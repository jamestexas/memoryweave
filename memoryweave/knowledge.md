# MemoryWeave Module Knowledge

## Module Purpose

This is the main package module for MemoryWeave. It provides the entry point for the package and exports the main components.

## Key Components

- Currently only contains a simple `main()` function that prints a greeting
- Will likely be expanded to export key functionality from submodules

## Usage

The package can be installed via pip and imported in Python code:

```python
import memoryweave
```

## Future Development

- Consider expanding the main module to provide a more comprehensive API
- Add CLI functionality for memory management operations
