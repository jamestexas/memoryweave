# Examples Module Knowledge

## Module Purpose
The examples module provides sample code demonstrating how to use MemoryWeave in different scenarios.

## Key Components
- `basic_usage.py`: Simple demonstration of core functionality
- `integration_example.py`: Shows how to integrate with LLM frameworks

## Usage Patterns
The examples show:
1. How to initialize the memory system
2. How to encode and store memories
3. How to retrieve relevant memories
4. How to integrate with LLM inference

## Implementation Details
- Examples use mock embedding models for demonstration
- They show both basic and advanced usage patterns
- Integration examples demonstrate framework-specific adapters

## Learning Path
1. Start with `basic_usage.py` to understand core concepts
2. Move to `integration_example.py` to see practical applications
3. Use these as templates for your own implementations
