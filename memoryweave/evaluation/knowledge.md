# Evaluation Module Knowledge

## Module Purpose
The evaluation module provides metrics and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the contextual fabric approach to memory management.

## Key Components
- `coherence_score`: Measures overall conversation coherence
- `context_relevance`: Evaluates how relevant retrieved memories are to queries
- `response_consistency`: Measures consistency between responses and memories
- `evaluate_conversation`: Comprehensive evaluation of a conversation

## Metrics
- **Coherence**: How well the conversation flows and maintains context
- **Relevance**: How well retrieved memories match the current query
- **Consistency**: How well responses incorporate retrieved memories

## Implementation Details
- Uses embedding similarity to measure semantic relationships
- Sliding window approach for coherence calculation
- Weighted averaging for relevance scoring

## Usage
These metrics can be used to:
1. Compare different memory retrieval strategies
2. Tune hyperparameters of the memory system
3. Evaluate the overall effectiveness of memory augmentation
