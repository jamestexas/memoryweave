# MemoryWeave Refactoring Progress

## Architecture Decision Record Summary

We've decided to refactor the MemoryWeave architecture to address several challenges with the current system:

1. **Monolithic components**: Core retrieval functionality in large, tightly-coupled modules
2. **Code duplication**: Similar functionality duplicated across files
3. **Poor separation of concerns**: Memory storage, retrieval logic, and query processing mixed
4. **Testing difficulties**: Complex components are difficult to test in isolation
5. **Limited extensibility**: Adding new features requires modifying core classes

The refactoring follows these key principles:
- Interface-first design with clear protocols for all components
- Single responsibility principle for each component
- Composition over inheritance to build complex behavior
- Progressive enhancement starting with simple implementations
- Backward compatibility through adapter layers

## Progress Summary

We've made substantial progress on the architecture refactoring, completing the first three phases of the implementation plan:

### Phase 1: Interface Definition & Core Boundaries ✅
### Phase 2: Core Components Implementation ✅
### Phase 3: Pipeline Architecture ✅

We've established:
- Clear interfaces for all components
- Comprehensive data models
- Implementation of storage, retrieval, and query components
- NLP utility modules
- Pipeline architecture for component orchestration
- Configuration system
- Factory methods for component creation

The next phases involve implementing adapters for backward compatibility, migrating existing features to the new architecture, and updating tests.

### Phase 2: Core Components Implementation ✅

- Created `/storage/` module with implementations:
  - `memory_store.py`: Basic memory storage implementation
  - `vector_store.py`: Vector similarity search implementations
  - `activation.py`: Memory activation tracking and decay
  - `category.py`: ART-inspired category management

- Created `/retrieval/` module with strategies:
  - `similarity.py`: Pure similarity-based retrieval
  - `temporal.py`: Recency-based retrieval
  - `hybrid.py`: Combined similarity and temporal retrieval
  - `two_stage.py`: Two-stage retrieval process

- Created `/query/` module for processing:
  - `analyzer.py`: Query type analysis and classification
  - `adaptation.py`: Parameter adaptation based on query type
  - `keyword.py`: Keyword extraction and expansion

- Created `/nlp/` module for utilities:
  - `extraction.py`: Core extraction functionality
  - `matchers.py`: Pattern matching utilities
  - `patterns.py`: Regular expression patterns
  - `keywords.py`: Keyword utilities

### Phase 3: Pipeline Architecture ✅

- Created `/pipeline/` module for orchestration:
  - `registry.py`: Component registry for managing components
  - `builder.py`: Pipeline builder for creating pipelines
  - `manager.py`: Pipeline manager for orchestrating pipelines
  - `executor.py`: Pipeline executor for running pipelines

- Created `/config/` module for configuration:
  - `options.py`: Configuration options and defaults
  - `validation.py`: Configuration validation
  - `loaders.py`: Configuration loading utilities

- Created `/factory/` module for component creation:
  - `memory.py`: Factory for memory components
  - `retrieval.py`: Factory for retrieval components
  - `pipeline.py`: Factory for pipeline components

### Next Steps

1. Create adapters for backward compatibility with existing code
2. Migrate feature implementations from old architecture to new
3. Update tests to work with the new architecture
4. Remove deprecated code once migration is complete
5. Complete comprehensive documentation

## Current Status

See `docs/feature_matrix.md` for detailed implementation status of components and features:

- ✅ Core interface definitions and data models
- ✅ Storage components implementation
- ✅ Retrieval strategies implementation
- ✅ Query components implementation
- ✅ NLP utilities implementation
- ✅ Pipeline architecture implementation
- ✅ Configuration system implementation
- ✅ Factory methods implementation
- ❌ Adapter layer implementation
- ❌ Migration of feature implementations
- ❌ Test updates for new architecture

## Advantages of the New Architecture

The refactored architecture offers several key advantages:

1. **Improved maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand
2. **Better testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Increased extensibility**: New components can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Clearer dependencies**: More explicit component relationships
5. **Easier collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Performance optimization**: Components can be optimized independently

## Migration Strategy

We're following these principles for a smooth migration:

1. **Adapter pattern**: Creating adapters between old and new architecture
2. **Parallel implementations**: Maintaining both implementations during transition
3. **Feature parity tracking**: Using feature matrix to track migration progress
4. **Test-driven migration**: Ensuring all features have tests before migration

The goal is to maintain functionality throughout the refactoring process while progressively improving the architecture.
