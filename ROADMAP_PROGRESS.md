# MemoryWeave Refactoring Progress

## Architecture Decision Record Summary

We've decided to refactor the MemoryWeave architecture to address several challenges with the current system:

1. **Monolithic components**: Core retrieval functionality in large, tightly-coupled modules
2. **Code duplication**: Similar functionality duplicated across files
3. **Poor separation of concerns**: Memory storage, retrieval logic, and query processing mixed
4. **Testing difficulties**: Complex components are difficult to test in isolation
5. **Limited extensibility**: Adding new features requires modifying core classes

The refactoring follows these key principles:
- Interface-first design with clear protocols for all components
- Single responsibility principle for each component
- Composition over inheritance to build complex behavior
- Progressive enhancement starting with simple implementations
- Backward compatibility through adapter layers

## Implementation Plan Progress

### Phase 1: Interface Definition & Core Boundaries ‚úÖ

- Created `/interfaces/` module with core interface protocols:
  - `memory.py`: Memory storage and retrieval interfaces
  - `retrieval.py`: Retrieval strategy interfaces 
  - `query.py`: Query processing interfaces
  - `pipeline.py`: Pipeline configuration interfaces

- Defined clear data models for components:
  - Memory representation with embeddings and metadata
  - Query representation with type and context
  - Retrieval parameters and results
  - Pipeline components and configuration

### Phase 2: Core Components Implementation üîÑ

- Created `/storage/` module with implementations:
  - `memory_store.py`: Basic memory storage implementation
  - `vector_store.py`: Vector similarity search implementations
  - `activation.py`: Memory activation tracking and decay
  - `category.py`: ART-inspired category management

- Upcoming tasks:
  - Create `/retrieval/` module for retrieval strategies
  - Create `/query/` module for query processing
  - Create `/nlp/` module for NLP utilities

### Next Steps

1. Implement retrieval strategies (similarity, temporal, hybrid, two-stage)
2. Create query processing components for analysis and adaptation
3. Implement the pipeline architecture for component orchestration
4. Create adapters for backward compatibility with existing code
5. Update tests and documentation

## Current Status

See `docs/feature_matrix.md` for detailed implementation status of components and features:

- ‚úÖ Core interface definitions and data models
- ‚úÖ Storage components implementation
- üîÑ Working on retrieval strategies implementation
- ‚ùå Query components not started
- ‚ùå Pipeline architecture not started

## Advantages of the New Architecture

The refactored architecture offers several key advantages:

1. **Improved maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand
2. **Better testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Increased extensibility**: New components can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Clearer dependencies**: More explicit component relationships
5. **Easier collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Performance optimization**: Components can be optimized independently

## Migration Strategy

We're following these principles for a smooth migration:

1. **Adapter pattern**: Creating adapters between old and new architecture
2. **Parallel implementations**: Maintaining both implementations during transition
3. **Feature parity tracking**: Using feature matrix to track migration progress
4. **Test-driven migration**: Ensuring all features have tests before migration

The goal is to maintain functionality throughout the refactoring process while progressively improving the architecture.
