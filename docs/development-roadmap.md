- Develop community-contributed memory strategies
- Add support for domain-specific optimizations

## Implementation Strategy

Our strategy for implementation follows these principles:

1. **Focus on core functionality first** - Ensure the basic memory management works well before adding advanced features
1. **Prioritize real-world use cases** - Implement features that solve actual user problems
1. **Test-driven development** - Create tests before implementing features
1. **Iterative refinement** - Build basic versions, then enhance based on testing
1. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Avoid breaking changes when possible

## Contribution Focus Areas

For contributors interested in helping, these areas would benefit most from additional attention:

1. Query analysis improvements
1. Performance optimization
1. Test coverage expansion
1. Documentation enhancement
1. Benchmark development

## Success Metrics

We'll measure success by:

1. **Retrieval precision and recall** - Compared to baseline vector search
1. **Memory efficiency** - How efficiently we use memory for storage
1. **Query latency** - Speed of memory retrieval
1. **Integration ease** - How easily MemoryWeave can be integrated with LLMs
1. **Scalability** - Performance with increasing memory sizes
