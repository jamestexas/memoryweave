# MemoryWeave Feature Matrix

This document tracks the implementation status of features from the original `ContextualRetriever` in the new component-based architecture.

## Status Legend
- ✅ Complete - Feature fully implemented in component architecture
- 🟡 Partial - Feature partially implemented
- ❌ Not Started - Feature not yet implemented
- 🔄 In Progress - Feature currently being implemented
