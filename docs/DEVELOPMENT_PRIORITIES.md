- [x] Add progressive filtering to narrow results as scale increases
  - Implemented progressive_filtering method for two-stage retrieval
  - Added integrated activation boosting with scale-adjusted weights
- [ ] Create specialized index structures for different query types
- [x] Implement dynamic vector partitioning for large memory stores
  - Added support for IVF-based indexes with configurable clustering
- [x] Add in-memory caching for frequently accessed vectors
  - Indexes are built lazily and cached

**Relevant Files:**
