# Next Steps for MemoryWeave Refactoring

## Phase 1: Stabilization (1-2 weeks)

### Fix Remaining Integration Tests

- **Benchmark Configurations**

  - Use standardized test fixtures for predictable data
  - Verify component-specific behavior rather than numeric differences

- **Benchmark Performance**

  - Standardize test data to accurately measure performance
  - Remove arbitrary performance thresholds
  - Ensure clear, specific assertions in tests

- **Pipeline Execution Tests**:

  - Ensure correct data passing between pipeline stages

## Query Analyzer Improvements

- Fix query type detection accuracy, particularly for queries like "Tell me about..."
- Improve keyword extraction logic, specifically filtering stopwords effectively
- Replace hard-coded special cases with consistent, reusable test fixtures

## Component Stabilization

- **Semantic Coherence Processor**:

  - Remove special-case handling from tests
  - Validate coherence metrics with realistic test data

- **Personal Attribute Manager**:

  - Standardize attribute handling and extraction
  - Eliminate hard-coded values and test-specific behaviors

## Benchmarking Improvements

- Enhance benchmarks to include realistic, multi-turn conversation scenarios
- Improve metric collection (MRR, nDCG)
- Add memory usage and detailed latency metrics
- Expand benchmark datasets to cover diverse query types

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilization (1-2 weeks)

- Fix remaining integration and unit test failures
- Address query analysis and classification issues
- Establish consistent memory storage and access patterns

### Phase 2: Architecture Enhancement (2-4 weeks)

- Consolidate duplicate retrieval implementations
- Extract shared utilities into dedicated modules
- Optimize hybrid retrieval (BM25 + Vector Search)
- Begin removing fully deprecated legacy code

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (3-4 weeks)

- Implement specialized index structures for query types
- Optimize vector retrieval precision and recall
- Add persistence layer for long-term memory storage
- Expand benchmarks for more diverse query types

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup (1-2 weeks)

- Complete API and architecture documentation
- Provide migration guides for users
- Finalize removal of deprecated components
- Add visualization tools and tutorials for key features

## Final Validation

- Ensure all tests and benchmarks run correctly
- Validate no special-case handling remains
- Confirm performance metrics meet or exceed legacy implementations
- Review documentation and usage examples thoroughly

This consolidated approach will ensure the MemoryWeave refactoring achieves improved maintainability, performance, and extensibility, setting a strong foundation for future development.
