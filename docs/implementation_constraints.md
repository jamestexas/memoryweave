# MemoryWeave Implementation Constraints

This document outlines key constraints and issues that need to be addressed in the current MemoryWeave implementation.

## Current Architecture Constraints

### 1. Duplicated Code

- **Multiple retrieval implementations**: Significant duplication between `retrieval.py`, `deprecated/core/retrieval.py`, and `refactored_retrieval.py`
- **Bridge/adapter pattern misuse**: Current adapters often duplicate logic rather than delegate to existing implementations
- **Core memory functionality**: Duplication across `contextual_memory.py`, `memory_manager.py`, and `memory_store.py`
- **Utility functions**: NLP extraction, similarity calculations, and other utilities duplicated across files

### 2. Inconsistent Interfaces

- **Memory access models**: Inconsistent between dictionary-style and attribute access (Memory object vs dict)
- **TypedDict vs dataclass**: Mixed use across different parts of the codebase leading to access pattern confusion
- **Function signatures**: Inconsistent parameter naming and ordering across similar methods

### 3. Test Limitations

- **Mock integration failures**: Several test failures due to interface inconsistencies
- **Missing test coverage**: Several components lack adequate test coverage
- **Brittle tests**: Tests often break when implementation details change
- **Hard-coded expectations**: Some tests have hard-coded expectations about query classification

### 4. Pipeline Architecture Issues

- **Inadequate communication between components**: Pipeline stages don't effectively share context
- **Limited configuration options**: Many parameters are hard-coded rather than configurable
- **Class resolution order problems**: Issues with multiple inheritance and generic parameters
- **Inflexible stage execution**: Pipeline execution doesn't allow for conditional processing paths

### 5. Performance Bottlenecks

- **Inefficient memory operations**: Multiple lookups for the same data
- **Redundant embedding calculations**: Embeddings sometimes calculated multiple times
- **No embedding caching**: Results aren't cached between similar queries
- **Benchmark limitations**: Current benchmarks show poor performance for component-based architecture

## Technical Debt Areas

### Immediate Concerns

- **Fix query analyzer tests**: Current tests fail with unrealistic expectations
- **Address pipeline execution failures**: Multi-stage pipeline tests are failing
- **Consistent memory access patterns**: Ensure consistent object vs dictionary access
- **Fix adapter/mock issues**: Several mock-based tests fail due to incorrect adapter implementations

### Medium-term Issues

- **Eliminate duplicate implementations**: Remove or properly delegate to the new architecture
- **Improve benchmarking methodology**: Current results show 0.0 precision/recall for component architecture
- **Extract shared utilities**: Move common functionality to dedicated utility classes
- **Complete feature matrix implementations**: Several features in the feature matrix remain unimplemented

### Long-term Architectural Goals

- **Proper dependency injection**: Replace direct object references with proper DI patterns
- **Clear component boundaries**: Better define responsibilities between components
- **Standardize on consistent models**: Adopt either TypedDict or dataclass approach consistently
- **Improve semantic coherence**: Current implementations fall short on semantic matching

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests to establish a stable baseline
1. Address issues with query analysis and classification
1. Improve benchmark methodology and implementation
1. Begin systematic refactoring to eliminate duplicate code
1. Document architectural decisions and patterns for consistent implementation
