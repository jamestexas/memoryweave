# MemoryWeave Roadmap and Progress

This document outlines the development roadmap for MemoryWeave and tracks progress on architectural refactoring and feature implementation.

## Current Status

MemoryWeave is undergoing a significant architectural refactoring from a monolithic design to a modular component-based architecture. The core memory management system with contextual fabric approach has been implemented, along with many key features:

- ART-inspired clustering for dynamic memory categorization
- Advanced retrieval mechanisms including two-stage retrieval and query adaptation
- Integration adapters for Hugging Face, OpenAI, and LangChain
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics for memory coherence and relevance

## Architecture Refactoring Progress

We've completed the first three phases of the implementation plan:

### ✅ Phase 1: Interface Definition & Core Boundaries
- Created interfaces for memory, retrieval, query processing, and pipeline components
- Defined comprehensive data models for components

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Components Implementation
- Created storage module with memory_store, vector_store, activation, and category implementations
- Created retrieval module with various retrieval strategy implementations
- Created query module for processing and adaptation
- Created NLP utilities for extraction, matching, patterns, and keywords

### ✅ Phase 3: Pipeline Architecture
- Created pipeline module for registry, builder, manager, and executor
- Created configuration module for options, validation, and loaders
- Created factory module for component creation

### ✅ Phase 4: Adapter Layer Implementation
- Created adapters module for backward compatibility
- Implemented bidirectional adapters for legacy and new components
- Added migration utilities and validation

### ✅ Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- Added comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Created migration guide and feature matrix
- Updated documentation and examples

## Next Steps

### Short-Term Focus

1. Fix and improve query analyzer accuracy
2. Add persistence layer for long-term memory storage
3. Optimize performance for large memory sets
4. Improve hybrid retrieval to combine BM25 and vector search advantages
5. Expand benchmarking datasets for more diverse query types
6. Implement visualization improvements for benchmark results
7. Enhance vector retrieval precision while maintaining high recall

### Medium-Term Focus

1. Continue feature migration from old architecture to new
2. Complete test coverage for all components
3. Organize integration demo of the full architecture
4. Begin removing deprecated code after full migration
5. Review backward compatibility requirements
6. Implement advanced memory organization features

## Advantages of the New Architecture

The refactored architecture offers several key advantages:

1. **Improved maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand
2. **Better testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Increased extensibility**: New components can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Clearer dependencies**: More explicit component relationships
5. **Easier collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Performance optimization**: Components can be optimized independently

## Migration Strategy

We're following these principles for a smooth migration:

1. **Adapter pattern**: Creating adapters between old and new architecture
2. **Parallel implementations**: Maintaining both implementations during transition
3. **Feature parity tracking**: Using feature matrix to track migration progress
4. **Test-driven migration**: Ensuring all features have tests before migration

The goal is to maintain functionality throughout the refactoring process while progressively improving the architecture.
