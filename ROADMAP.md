# MemoryWeave Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned developments for the MemoryWeave project, focusing on practical applications and demonstrations of its capabilities.

## Current Status

- [ ] Core memory fabric implementation with contextual retrieval ✅
- [ ] ART-inspired category clustering system ✅
- [ ] Category consolidation to reduce fragmentation ✅ 
- [ ] Confidence thresholding for retrieval precision ✅
- [ ] Semantic coherence checks ✅
- [ ] Adaptive retrieval selection ✅

## Next Steps

### 1. Focused Demo Application

**Priority: High**

Create a real-world chatbot demo to showcase MemoryWeave's capabilities in action.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Build a simple web or CLI interface that allows conversation with an assistant
- Integrate with a language model (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Claude)
- Add visualization that shows retrieved memories alongside responses
- Include functionality to inspect memory categories and activation patterns
- Implement a "debug mode" that exposes the retrieval decisions

**Benefits:**
- Provides concrete evidence of MemoryWeave's advantages
- Generates compelling examples for presentations/papers
- Identifies practical limitations that benchmarks might miss

### 2. Specialized Benchmark Scenarios

**Priority: Medium**

Develop benchmarks that specifically target MemoryWeave's unique strengths.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Long-context retrieval: Test information recall across 50+ turns
- Implicit reference resolution: Measure ability to handle vague references
- Topic revisitation: Test reconnection to previously discussed topics after digressions
- Cross-domain knowledge integration: Assess connecting information across domains

### 3. Hierarchical Memory Organization

**Priority: Medium**

Implement a hierarchical structure to better organize memories.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Design a multi-level retrieval system (categories → subcategories → memories)
- Implement topic modeling for automatic hierarchical organization
- Create visualization tools for the memory hierarchy
- Add summarization capabilities to create higher-level memory abstractions

### 4. Continuous Learning Integration

**Priority: Low**

Explore how MemoryWeave can support continuous learning.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Develop experiments showing how memory structure retains information during model updates
- Design benchmarks measuring catastrophic forgetting with and without our approach
- Create a small demo showing conversation coherence maintenance during learning

## Performance Optimizations

- **Hierarchical Retrieval**: Use category-level retrieval first, then retrieve within categories
- **Recency Boosting**: Weight more recent memories higher but don't neglect thematically relevant older ones
- **Query Reformulation**: Expand the query with related concepts to improve recall
- **Memory Consolidation**: Implement periodic review and consolidation of related memories

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- Optimize memory search for larger memory stores
- Add persistent storage options (SQLite, Vector DB)
- Improve test coverage and documentation
- Create proper Python packaging
