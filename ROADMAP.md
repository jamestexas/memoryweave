# MemoryWeave Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the MemoryWeave project.

## Current Status

MemoryWeave is in early development with the following components implemented:

- Core memory management system with contextual fabric approach
- ART-inspired clustering for dynamic memory categorization
- Basic retrieval mechanisms with similarity and recency-based approaches
- Integration adapters for Hugging Face, OpenAI, and LangChain
- Evaluation metrics for memory coherence and relevance
- Enhanced retrieval mechanisms including two-stage retrieval and query type adaptation

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Memory System Enhancements
- [x] Implement confidence thresholding for improved precision
- [x] Add semantic coherence check for retrieved memories
- [x] Develop adaptive K selection for dynamic result set sizing
- [x] Implement two-stage retrieval pipeline
- [x] Add query type adaptation for factual vs. personal queries
- [x] Implement dynamic threshold adjustment
- [x] Add memory decay for temporal relevance
- [ ] Improve personal attribute extraction with more robust patterns
- [ ] Add support for entity recognition in memory encoding

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize vector operations with batched processing
- [ ] Add support for quantized embeddings to reduce memory footprint
