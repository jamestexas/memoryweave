# MemoryWeave

MemoryWeave is a novel approach to memory management for language models that uses a "contextual fabric" approach inspired by biological memory systems. Instead of traditional knowledge graph approaches with discrete nodes and edges, MemoryWeave focuses on capturing rich contextual signatures of information for improved long-context coherence in language model conversations.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Fabric**: Memory traces capture rich contextual signatures rather than isolated facts
- **Activation-Based Retrieval**: Memory retrieval uses dynamic activation patterns similar to biological systems
- **Episodic Structure**: Memories maintain temporal relationships and episodic anchoring
- **Non-Structured Memory**: Works with raw LLM outputs without requiring structured formats
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily integrates with existing LLM inference frameworks

## Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv pip install memoryweave

# Using pip
pip install memoryweave
