"""
Tests for the SemanticCoherenceProcessor component.

This module tests the SemanticCoherenceProcessor component to ensure:
1. It applies penalties for incoherent results when enabled
2. It properly skips processing when disabled
3. It identifies outliers and promotes coherent result clusters
4. Different configurations use different coherence parameters
